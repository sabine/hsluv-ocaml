{0 HSLuv}

HSLuv is a color space designed to provide a more human-friendly and uniform representation of colors, compared to traditional color spaces like RGB or HSL.

The key feature of HSLuv is its ability to maintain perceived color brightness and contrast uniformly across its hue and saturation range.

HSLuv is particularly useful in applications where color consistency and perceptual uniformity are important, such as in graphical design, data visualization, and user interface development.
